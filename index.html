              This is a website that's under construction at the moment. Over here you can find VR related stuff, Blender related stuff, and Unity related stuff. There's also help for these various topics. If you need help with something very specific, it's worth taking a look. Or maybe stay around to see what gets added in the future. If you message me with something, maybe something you'd like to show off or something you wrote, I'll (probably) actually put it on here.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              (REMEMBER THIS WEBSITE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION) This website was set up for a couple reasons. Firstly, mostly everything is VRChat related, or 3D modeling related. I wanted somewhere to post stuff involving me and my friends. I also want to make some tutorials that are actually good and comprehensive. Tutorials for both Unity and Blender. Some tutorials aren't really good at explaining certain stuff, outdated, or drag on things that can be explained much more quicker. Sometimes they aren't really beginner friendly. I would like to fix this wrong. Plus I wanted a custom domain to put as my Bluesky handle.

          <div id="contact" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>
              I still need to set up a private email for this domain. Until then, just scream "PARASOL DOT MOE" outside your house and I might show up. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/parasol.moe">You could also contact me on Bluesky, that's sometimes much more reliable.</a>
