              This is a website that's under construction at the moment. I feel like there's a lot of Unity and Blender tutorials which don't explain things well or drag on about a subject which could be explained a lot more quicker so I wanted to try to make more comprehensive, beginner friendly stuff. This is mostly for VRChat related things involving those two programs. Hell, I'll also explain how to deal with certain errors for the people who happen to be googling those things.

            <p>
              (REMEMBER THIS WEBSITE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION) This website was set up for a couple reasons. Firstly, mostly everything is VRChat related, or 3D modeling related. I wanted somewhere to post stuff involving me and my friends. I also want to make some tutorials that are actually good and comprehensive. Tutorials for both Unity and Blender. Some tutorials aren't really good at explaining certain stuff, outdated, or drag on things that can be explained much more quicker. Sometimes they aren't really beginner friendly. I would like to fix this wrong. Plus I wanted a custom domain to put as my Bluesky handle.

          <div id="contact" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>
              I still need to set up a private email for this domain. Until then, just scream "PARASOL DOT MOE" outside your house and I might show up. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/parasol.moe">You could also contact me on Bluesky, that's sometimes much more reliable.</a>
